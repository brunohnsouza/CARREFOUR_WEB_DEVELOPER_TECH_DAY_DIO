# ðŸš€ INFORMATIONS:

### ðŸ”Ž OBJECTIVE: *Consume two EndPoints provided by Carrefour.*
- **Search Points of Sale By CEP (1st EndPoint):** when typing your CEP, a list with the nearest Carrefour STORES will be returned in the console;
- **Search Products By Point of Sale (2nd EndPoint):** when typing the name of the Carrefour STORE, a list of products available in that STORE will be returned in the console.

### ðŸ”§ TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS e JAVASCRIPT;
- **Plug-in JQuery:** Own-Carousel 2.

### ðŸ’¡ IDEAS IMPLEMENTED:
- **Dark theme:**
    - It helps users with **_photophobia_** (sensitivity to light);
    - Prevention of visual problems;
    - Less emission of **_blue light_**.
    
- **Mobile First:**
    - Features of a mobile device;
    - Developed in 360 x 640 resolution (Galaxy Note 3).
    
- **Usable search bar:**
    - Redirects to the official website.
    
### ðŸ§— DIFFICULTIES AND OVERCOMES:
- **Use of EndPoints:** 
    - Problems with 'Cors' (although the results are not displayed on the conventional screen, the result worked on the console).

- **Responsiveness:** 
    - Multiple screens (it took me a while, but the multi-screen responsiveness was accomplished with dedication and effort).

- **Javascript:**
    - Without much experience (even so, several parts were coded with this language and the baggage of knowledge increased).
